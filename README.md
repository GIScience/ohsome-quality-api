The ohsome quality API computes and provides data quality estimations (indicators) for OpenStreetMap.

Thanks to the [ohsome dashboard](https://dashboard.ohsome.org) generating quality estimations of OpenStreetMap data for an arbitrary region is as easy as pie.

The software is developed by [Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT)](https://heigit.org/) and based on the [ohsome platform](https://heigit.org/big-spatial-data-analytics-en/ohsome/).
