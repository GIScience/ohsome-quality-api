Thanks to the [ohsome dashboard](https://ohsome.org/apps/dashboard/) generating quality estimations of OpenStreetMap data for an arbitrary region is now as easy as pie.

The ohsome quality analyst (OQT) computes and provides data quality estimations (indicators) for OpenStreetMap.

The software is developed by [Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT)](https://heigit.org/) and based on the [ohsome platform](https://heigit.org/big-spatial-data-analytics-en/ohsome/).
