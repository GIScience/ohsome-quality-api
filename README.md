The ohsome quality analyst (OQT) computes and provides data quality estimations (indicators) for OpenStreetMap.

The software is developed by [Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT)](https://heigit.org/) and based on the [ohsome platform](https://heigit.org/big-spatial-data-analytics-en/ohsome/).

## Blog

The following blog posts give insight into OQT:
- [Introducing the ohsome quality analyst (OQT)](https://heigit.org/introducing-the-ohsome-quality-analyst-oqt)
- [Behind the scenes of the ohsome quality analyst (OQT)](https://heigit.org/behind-the-scenes-of-the-ohsome-quality-analyst-oqt)
- as well as other [blog posts about OQT](https://heigit.org/tag/oqt-en)

## Website

The easiest access to quality estimations is through our [website](https://oqt.ohsome.org). There reports with pre-computed indicators can be accessed for a selection of regions made by the OQT team. Currently it is not possible to upload custom areas-of-interest (AOIs) and compute report or indicators for those.

## API

Our [API](https://oqt.ohsome.org/api/docs) offers the most flexible way to request quality estimations from OQT. It is possible to request pre-computed indicators for a selection of regions made by the OQT team as well as for your own areas-of-interest (GeoJSON). At the moment a limitation on the area of the input geometry exists. The API will return a GeoJSON Feature. This GeoJSON will preserve both the `geometry` and `property` field of the input GeoJSON Feature. The data and results of a computed indicator are written to the `properties` field of the resulting GeoJSON Feature.

 For more information check out the interactive [API documentation](https://oqt.ohsome.org/api/docs), our static [documentation](docs/api.md) and our interactive [examples](https://github.com/GIScience/oqt-examples) using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
