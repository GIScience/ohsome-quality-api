    The Sketch Map Fitness Report consists of four data quality indicators
    (mapping saturation of major roads, currentness of major roads and
    amenities, density of landmarks). The report tells you whether
    you should expect potential problems when using OSM-based Sketch 
    Maps for the area of interest.

    red: >-
      The report indicates low quality of the underlying OSM data.
      It is likely that it is not possible to use
      the Sketch Map Tool for this area without first improving the local OSM data, 
      e.g. through a Mapathon.
    yellow: >-
      The report indicates medium quality of the underlying OSM data.
      You should inspect the results for the individual indicators
      to identify potential data quality concerns.
    green: >-
      This region seems to be well suited for mapping
      using the Sketch Map Tool.
    undefined: >-
      Could not derive quality level.
