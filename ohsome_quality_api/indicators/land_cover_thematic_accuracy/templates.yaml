    In your area-of-interes the thematic accuracy of $clc_class is $f1_score %
    (low agreement between OSM and CORINE). This suggests that OSM has a poor
    classification quality or incomplete land cover data.
  yellow: >-
    In your area-of-interes the thematic accuracy of $clc_class is $f1_score %
    (medium agreement between OSM and CORINE). This suggests that OSM does
    capture some land cover categories but may lack detail or accuracy.
  green: >-
    In your area-of-interes the thematic accuracy of $clc_class is $f1_score %
    (high agreement between OSM and CORINE). This suggests that OSM provides a
    reliable representation of land cover.
  undefined: >-
    The F1-score could not be calculated, possibly due to missing or incompatible data in the selected region.

  The thematic accuracy of OpenStreetMap (OSM) land cover data is determined in
  comparison to the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) data. The comparison uses a
  statistical metric (F1-Score) which considers both the correctness and
  completeness of the land cover categories. A higher score means OSM land
  cover data closely reflects that of the reference dataset (CORINE).
