result_description: >-
  The current match quality between OSM land use data and official land cover data from CORINE
  in the area-of-interest is $score %. The match is assessed using a statistical metric (F1-Score) that considers both 
  the correctness and completeness of the land use categories. A higher score means OSM land use closely reflects the
  official data.
