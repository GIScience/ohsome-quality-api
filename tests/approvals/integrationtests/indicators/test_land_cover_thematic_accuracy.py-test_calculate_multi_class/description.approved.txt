The thematic accuracy of OpenStreetMap (OSM) land cover data is determined in comparison to the <a href="https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/corine-land-cover">CORINE Land Cover (CLC)</a> data. The comparison uses a statistical metric (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score">F1-Score</a>) which considers both the correctness and completeness of the land cover categories. A higher score means OSM land cover data closely reflects that of the reference dataset (CORINE). In your area-of-interes the thematic accuracy of all CLC classes is 82.32 % (high agreement between OSM and CORINE). This suggests that OSM provides a reliable representation of land cover.
