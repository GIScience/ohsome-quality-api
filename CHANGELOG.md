### How to Upgrade

#### API

- change JSON keys in request and response models:
  - (1) hyphen case for identifiers such as indicator, report and topic keys ([#398])
  - (2) camel case for other keys ([#603])
- for requests to the API endpoint `/indicators/{key}` for a custom topic add another field `key` of type string ([#517]):
```json
{
    "bpolys": {...},
    "topic": {
        "key": "my-key",
        "name": "my-name",
        "description": "my-description",
        "data": {...}
    }
}
```
- change parsing of error messages to work with following schema ([#562]):
```json
{
  "apiVersion": "__version__",
  "type": "exception.name",
  "detail": [
    {
      "msg": "exception.message"
    }
  ]
}
```

| indicator key | `TagsRatio`  | `attribute-completeness` |
| indicator key | `PoiDensity` | `density`                |
| indicator key | _CamelCase_  | _hyphen-case_            |
| report key    | _CamelCase_  | _hyphen-case_            |
| topic key     | _snake_case_ | _hyphen-case_            |
