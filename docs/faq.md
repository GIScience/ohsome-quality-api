### Mapping Saturation

#### How does the Mapping Saturation relate to mapping activity?

A saturation of 100 % means that the gradient or slope of the last bit (i.e. last 3 years) of the fitted curve is 1.0 (horizontal line). This again means that no mapping has been done in this period. Hopefully because there is nothing to map. That is the premise of the Mapping Saturation indicator: Each aggregation of features (e.g. length of roads or count of building) has a maximum. After increased mapping activity saturation is reached near this maximum.

#### Why does the curve of Mapping Saturation decline sometimes?

In case that features or tags are deleted the fitted curve can decline.

### Currentness

#### Can smaller time periods (e.g. monthly) be used for computing the Currentness Indicator?

In term of content there is no reason why a smaller time period could not be used.

#### How does deleted features or time periods without any mapping influence the Currentness result?
