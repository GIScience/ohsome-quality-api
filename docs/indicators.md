## Mapping Saturation

Calculate the saturation within the last 3 years.
Time period is one month since 2008.


Different statistical models are used to find out if saturation is reached.


### Methods and Data

- Intrinsic approach.

Premise: 

The added number of OSM objects of a specific feature class per time period decreases as the
number of mapped objects converges against the (un-
kown) true number of objects. 

Each aggregation of features (e.g. length of roads or count of building)
has a maximum. After increased mapping activity saturation is reached near this
maximum.
