# Development Setup

To run all components (OQT/API, Database, Website) in Docker containers simply run:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up -d
```

After all services are up they are available under:

- Website: [http://127.0.0.1:8081/](http://127.0.0.1:8081/)
- API: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)
- Database: `host=localhost port=5445 dbname=oqt user=oqt password=oqt`

Please continue reading for more information on each one of those services. If running into issues during the setup please check the [troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting.md) document. Also feel free to reach out to us.


## Database

A database for development purposes is provided as Dockerfile. This database contains custom regions, regions for running tests and datasets (E.g. SHDI) for those regions. To build and run an already configured image run:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up -d oqt-database
```

During building of the database Docker image data for development purposes is downloaded. When the database container is running for the first time it takes a few seconds until the database is initialized and ready to accept connections.
Check the progress with `docker logs oqt-database`.

To reinitialize or update the database make sure to delete the volume and rebuild the image. This will delete all data in the database:

```bash
# Make sure that your git is up2date, e.g. git pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml down --remove-orphans --volumes
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up -d --force-recreate --build oqt-database
```

To avoid using the cache of Docker run:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml build --no-cache
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up -d
```

> If for development purposes additional datasets are required please have a look at the scripts found in the `database/init_db.production` directory.


### Database for running tests

A minimal database setup for running tests is provided. If the build argument `OQT_TEST_DB` is set to `True` a database is initialized with data only for the regions used by the tests. No (additional) data is downloaded as is the case with the database setup for development.


## Raster Datasets

Please refer to [/docs/raster_datasets.md](/docs/raster_datasets.md).


## OQT Python package


### Requirements

- Python: ≥ 3.8 and < 3.10
- Poetry: ≥ 1.1
- R: ≥ 4.0

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for packaging and dependencies management. Please make sure it is installed on your system.


### Installation

```bash
cd workers/
poetry install
poetry shell  # Spawns a shell within the virtual environment.
pre-commit install  # Install pre-commit hooks.
# Hack away
```


### Configuration

For all possible configuration parameter please refer to the [configuration documentation](/docs/configuration.md).

For local development no additional configuration is required. Per default OQT will connect to the database defined in `docker-compose.development.yml`.


### Usage


#### CLI

```bash
oqt --help
```


#### API


##### Start the API using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up -d oqt-workers
```


##### Start the API using a Python script:

```bash
cd workers/scripts
python start_api.py
```

Default host is 127.0.0.1 and port is 8080. To change this, provide the corresponding parameter:

```bash
python start_api.py --help
Usage: start_api.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --host TEXT     [default: 127.0.0.1]
  --port INTEGER  [default: 8080]
  --help          Show this message and exit.
```


##### Endpoints

Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs) and check out the endpoints.

Alternative query the API from a terminal using CURL:

```bash
# GET request for an indicator
curl \
    -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8080/indicator/GhsPopComparisonBuildings?layerKey=building_count&dataset=regions&featureId=1" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    | python -m json.tool > response.json


# POST request for a report
curl \
    -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/report/MinimalTestReport" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -d '{"dataset": "regions", "featureId": 1}' \
    | python -m json.tool > response.json
```


### Tests

All relevant components should be tested. Please write tests for newly integrated functionality. 

Tests are written using the [unittest library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
The test runner is [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
Tests are separated into integration tests and unit tests.
Unit tests should run without having access to the database or services on the internet (e.g. ohsome API).

Run all tests:

```bash
cd workers/
pytest tests
```


#### Writing tests


##### VCR (videocassette recorder) for tests

All tests that are calling function, which are dependent on external resources (e.g. ohsome API) have to use the [VCR.py](https://vcrpy.readthedocs.io) module: "VCR.py records all HTTP interactions that take place […]."
This ensures that the positive test result is not dependent on the external resource. The cassettes are stored in the test directory within [fixtures/vcr_cassettes](/workers/tests/integrationtests/fixtures/vcr_cassettes). These cassettes are supposed to be integrated (committed and pushed) to the repository.

The VCR [record mode](https://vcrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#record-modes) is configurable through the environment variable `VCR_RECORD_MODE`. To ensure that every request is covered by cassettes, run the tests with the record mode `none`. If necessary, the cassettes can be re-recorded by deleting the cassettes and run all tests again, or using the record mode `all`. This is not necessary in normal cases, because not-yet-stored requests are downloaded automatically.

Writing tests using VCR.py with our custom decorator is as easy as: 

```python
from .utils import oqt_vcr

class TestSomething(unittest.TestCase):

    @oqt_vcr.use_cassette()
    def test_something(self):
        oqt.do_something(…)
        self.assertSomething(something)
```

Good examples can be found in [test_oqt.py](/workers/tests/integrationtests/test_oqt.py).


##### Asynchronous functions

When writing tests for functions which are asynchronous (using the `async/await` pattern) such as the `preprocess` functions of indicator classes, those functions should be called as follows: `asyncio.run(indicator.preprocess())`.


### Logging

Logging is enabled by default.

`ohsome_quality_analyst` uses the [logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).

#### Configuration

The logging module is configured in `config.py`. Both entry-points to
`ohsome_quality_analyst`, the `cli.py` and the `api.py`, will call the configuration
function defined in `definitions.py`. The default log level is `INFO`. This can be
overwritten by setting the environment variable `OQT_LOG_LEVEL` (See also the
[configuration documentation](docs/configuration.md)).

#### Usage

```python
import logging

logging.info("Logging message")
```
