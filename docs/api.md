# API

Please take a look at the [interactive Swagger UI](https://api.quality.ohsome.org/v1/docs) to explore the API.

We also provide a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/GIScience/ohsome-quality-api-examples) with examples on how to use the ohsome quality API with Python.

Have a look at this [blog post](https://heigit.org/de/visualizing-oqt-api-results-in-qgis-2/) to learn how to visualize the ohsome quality API Response in QGIS.
