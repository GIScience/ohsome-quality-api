# API

Please have a look at the request examples of the [interactive Swagger UI](https://oqt.ohsome.org/api/docs).
Using the Swagger UI one can create valid `cURL` requests with using an interactive interface.


## Indicator Endpoint

Three types of requests can be made:

- To request an Indicator for an AOI defined by OQT provide the following parameters: `name`, `topic`, `dataset` and `featureId`
- To request an Indicator for a custom AOI provide the following parameters: parameters: `name`, `topic` and `bpolys`
- To request an Indicator for a custom AOI and custom data provide the following parameters: `name`, `bpolys` and `topic`

Depending on the input, the output will be a GeoJSON Feature or FeatureCollection with the results of the Indicator as properties. The Feature properties of the input GeoJSON will be preserved if they do not collide with the properties set by OQT.

### Parameters

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                                                       |

| `name`        | Name of the indicator                                                                                                                             |

| `dataset`     | Name of the dataset containing bounding polygons                                                                                                  |
| `featureId`   | Identifier of the feature in the dataset                                                                                                          |
| `bpolys`      | Bounding polygon(s) as GeoJSON Feature, FeatureCollection, Polygon or MultiPolygon object. The Geometry has to be of type Polygon or MultiPolygon |
| `topic`       | Name, description and data of a custom topic. Data has to be provided in the same format as the response of the ohsome API would look like        |
| `includeSvg`  | Include a SVG string of a figure displaying the Indicator results                                                                                 |

Parameters are in part mutual exclusive (e.g. either `dataset` and `featureId` or `bpolys`). If the response contains multiple errors probably not all required parameters and/or mutual exclusive parameters have been provided.

### A Note on the Difference of `GET` and `POST` Requests

A request can be made to the `/indicator` endpoint using either the `GET` or `POST` method. For `GET` requests to this endpoint, only the parameters `dataset` and `feature_id` are supported. This means that it is not possible to create an indicator for a custom AOI using the `bpolys` parameter by making a `GET` request to the API.

Using the `POST` method all types of requests (see above) and parameters are supported.

### Request an Indicator for an OQT AOI using Python and `requests` Library

```python
import requests

    "dataset": "regions",
    "featureId": 3,
    "fidField": "ogc_fid",  # Optional
    "includeSvg": False,  # Optional
    "includeHtml": False,  # Optional
    "flatten": False,  # Optional
}
# Response using the GET method
response = requests.get(url, params=parameters)
# Response using the POST method
response = requests.post(url, json=parameters)
```

### Request an Indicator for a custom AOI using Python and `requests` Library

### Request an Indicator for a custom AOI and Topic using Python and `requests` Library

The data attached to a custom topic has to be in the same structure as the ohsome API response: [https://docs.ohsome.org/ohsome-api/stable](https://docs.ohsome.org/ohsome-api/stable)

Data used in this example has been taken from the ohsome API response of following request URL: [https://api.ohsome.org/v1/elements/count?bboxes=8.67%2C49.39%2C8.71%2C49.42&filter=building%3D\*%20and%20geometry%3Apolygon&format=json&time=2014-01-01%2F2017-01-01%2FP1M](https://api.ohsome.org/v1/elements/count?bboxes=8.67%2C49.39%2C8.71%2C49.42&filter=building%3D*%20and%20geometry%3Apolygon&format=json&time=2014-01-01%2F2017-01-01%2FP1M)

## Report Endpoint

Two types of requests can be made:

- To request a Report for an AOI defined by OQT provide the following parameters: `name`, `dataset` and `featureId`
- To request a Report for a custom AOI provide the following parameters: parameters: `name` and `bpolys`

Depending on the input, the output will be a GeoJSON Feature or FeatureCollection with the results of the Report and each Indicator as properties. The Feature properties of the input GeoJSON will be preserved if they do not collide with the properties set by OQT.

### Parameters

| `dataset`     | Name of the dataset containing bounding polygons                                                                                                  |
| `featureId`   | Identifier of the feature in the dataset                                                                                                          |
| `bpolys`      | Bounding polygon(s) as GeoJSON Feature, FeatureCollection, Polygon or MultiPolygon object. The Geometry has to be of type Polygon or MultiPolygon |
| `includeSvg`  | Include a SVG string of a figure displaying the Indicator results                                                                                 |

Some parameters are mutually exclusive (E.g. either `dataset` and `featureId` or `bpolys`). If the response contains multiple errors, it is likely that not all required parameters and/or mutually exclusive parameters have been provided.

### A Note on the Difference of `GET` and `POST` Requests

A request can be made to the `/report` endpoint using either the `GET` or `POST` method. For `GET` requests to this endpoint, only the `dataset` and `feature_id` parameters are supported. That means that it is not possible to create a Report for a custom AOI using the `bpolys` parameter by making a `GET` request to the API.

Using the `POST` method all types of requests (see above) and parameters are supported.
