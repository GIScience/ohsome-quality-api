  name: Multilevel Mapping Saturation
  description: |
    This report shows the mapping saturation of four major Map Features (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features): buildings, land-use/land-cover, points of interest and infrastructure.
    It evolved from the OSM Element Vectorisation tool (https://gitlab.gistools.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/giscience/ideal-vgi/osm-element-vectorisation).
  label-description:
    red: |
      The general mapping saturation for central elements in this region is low indicating a very early stage of the data.
    yellow: |
      The area experiences a considerable amount of mapping but is still growing.
    green: |
      This area is either well mapped or otherwise stale.
    undefined: |
      The quality level could not be calculated, possibly due to no convergence in the model.
