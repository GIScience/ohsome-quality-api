MappingSaturation:
  name: Mapping Saturation
  description: |
    Calculate if mapping has saturated.
    High saturation has been reached if the growth of the fitted curve is minimal.
  label_description:
    red: |
      No saturation identified (Saturation ≤ 30%).
    yellow: |
      Saturation is in progress (30% < Saturation ≤ 97%).
    green: |
      High saturation has been reached (97% < Saturation ≤ 100%).
    undefined: |
      Saturation could not be calculated.
  result_description: |
    The saturation of the last 3 years is $saturation%.
