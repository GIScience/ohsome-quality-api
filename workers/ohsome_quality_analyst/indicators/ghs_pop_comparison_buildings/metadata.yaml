  name: GHS-POP Comparison Buildings
  description: |
    Comparison between population density and feature density.
    This can give an estimate if mapping has been completed.
  label-description:
    red: |
      The comparison of population density and building density shows, that 
      a majority of buildings has not been mapped yet. This results in a bad 
      data quality in respect to completeness
    yellow: |
      The comparison between population density and building density indicate 
      that there are still unmapped buildings. This results in a medium 
      data quality in respect to completeness.
    green: |
      For the given population density, this is a relatively high value and 
      indicates a good data quality in terms of completeness.
    undefined: |
      The quality level could not be calculated for this indicator.
  result-description: |
    Following the GHS POP dataset, there are 
    $pop_count people living in an area of 
    $area sqkm, which results in a population density 
    $pop_count_per_sqkm of people per sqkm.
    $feature_count_per_sqkm buildings per sqkm mapped.
