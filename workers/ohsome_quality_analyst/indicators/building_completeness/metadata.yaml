building-completeness:
  name: Building Completeness
  description: |
    Weighted average of the ratio between predicted building area and the actual building area in OSM.
    This can give an estimate if mapping has been completed.
  label-description:
    red: |
      The building area mapped in OSM is significantly less than predicted.
      This indicates that the vast majority of buildings have not been mapped yet.
    yellow: |
      The building area mapped in OSM is less than predicted. This indicates
      that some buildings are mapped but not all.
    green: |
      The building area mapped in OSM matches or exceeds the predicted building
      area. This indicates good coverage of buildings in OSM.
      (Weighted averages above 100% are due to uncertainties in the ML model).
    undefined: |
      The quality level could not be calculated for this indicator.
  result-description: |
    For the AOI the building area mapped in OSM is $building_area_osm sqkm and
    the predicted building area is $building_area_prediction sqkm. The weighted
    average of the ratios per hex-cell between the building area mapped in OSM and the
    predicted building area is $completeness_ratio %. The weight is the
    predicted building area.
