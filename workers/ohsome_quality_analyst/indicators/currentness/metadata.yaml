      The quality level could not be calculated for this indicator. 
      This is most likely due to the fact that no features have been mapped 
      for this area of interest. Refer to other indicators that rely on 
      an extrinsic comparison to identify if this means that data quality is 
      bad or if there is just nothing to map here.

      In the last $threshold_green years $green % of the elements were edited the last time.
      In the period from $threshold_yellow_start to $threshold_yellow_end years ago $yellow % of the elements were edited the last time.
      The remaining $red % were last edited more than $threshold_red years ago.
      The median currentness of the $elements features ($layer_name) is $median_years year(s).
      Note that only contributions uo to the $end_date are taken into account.
