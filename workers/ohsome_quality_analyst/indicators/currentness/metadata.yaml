      The quality level could not be calculated for this indicator. 
      This is most likely due to the fact that no features have been mapped 
      for this area of interest. Refer to other indicators that rely on 
      an extrinsic comparison to identify if this means that data quality is 
      bad or if there is just nothing to map here.
