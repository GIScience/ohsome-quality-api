  name: GHS-POP Comparison Roads
  description: |
    Comparison between population density and road density.
    This can give an estimate if mapping has been completed.
  label-description:
    red: |
      The comparison of population density and road density, that
      a majority of roads has not been mapped yet. This results in a bad
      data quality in respect to completeness
    yellow: |
      The comparison between population density and road density indicate
      that there might be still unmapped roads. This results in a medium
      data quality in respect to completeness.
    green: |
      For the given population density, this is a relatively high value and 
      indicates a good data quality in terms of completeness.
    undefined: |
      The quality level could not be calculated for this indicator.
  result-description: |
    Following the GHS POP dataset, there are 
    $pop_count people living in an area of 
    $area sqkm, which results in a population density 
    $pop_count_per_sqkm of people per sqkm.
    $feature_length_per_sqkm km of roads per sqkm mapped.
